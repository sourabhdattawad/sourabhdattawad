I'm Sourabh, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Linguistics at the [Institute for Natural Language Processing, University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/study/study-programs/Computational-Linguistics-M.Sc-00001./) in Germany.

I have more than 4 years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, involved in building large scale machine learning systems at companies like  [Daimler AG](https://www.daimler.com/) and [Cisco AI](https://www.cisco.com/). Further details about my experience can be found in my [CV]().

I have a strong love for the outdoors, particularly traveling, trekking and hiking. I have dedicated considerable time to exploring the Himalayas and the realm of Indic spirituality. Additionally, I have done some backpacking in India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and several places in Europe.

I am always eager for engaging conversations about life, technology, and any other topic. Feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:sourabhdattawad@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourabhdattawad).

> वहाँ कौन है तेरा, मुसाफ़िर? जाएगा कहाँ?  
दम ले-ले घड़ी-भर, ये छय्याँ पाएगा कहाँ?

> Oh wanderer, to what destination do you journey? Whom do you seek there?  
Take a deep breath for a moment, where else can you find such respite?
