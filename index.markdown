I'm Sourabh, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Linguistics at the [Institute for Natural Language Processing, University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/study/study-programs/Computational-Linguistics-M.Sc-00001./) in Germany.

I have more than 4 years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, involved in building large scale machine learning systems at companies like  [Daimler AG](https://www.daimler.com/) and [Cisco AI](https://www.cisco.com/). Further details about my experience can be found in my [CV](https://europa.eu/europass/eportfolio/screen/share/documents/262ffc37-9995-4caa-850d-bce30690521d?lang=en).

    I have a strong love for the outdoors, particularly traveling, trekking, and hiking. I have dedicated considerable time to exploring the Himalayas and the realm of Indic spirituality. I have some backpacking experience in Asia and some places in Europe.

    I am always eager for engaging conversations about life, technology, and any other topic. Feel free to contact me through <a href="mailto:sourabhdattawad@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourabhdattawad">LinkedIn</a>.
